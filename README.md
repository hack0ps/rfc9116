# RFC 9116 check

**Archived, moved to gitlab.com**

When security vulnerabilities are discovered by researchers, proper reporting channels are often lacking. As a result, vulnerabilities may be left unreported. [RFC9116](https://securitytxt.org/) defines a machine-parsable format ("security.txt") to help organizations describe their vulnerability disclosure practices to make it easier for researchers to report vulnerabilities.Â¶
